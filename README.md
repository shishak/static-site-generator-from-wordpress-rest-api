# Static Site Generator
## Using Wordpress REST API (and some other stuff)

A setup to create a simple and very fast blog / static site based on a Wordpress blog.

## Getting startet
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the build `npm start`
- We're done! Your site is now in the `build` directory.

## Roadmap
Larger than Google Maps
