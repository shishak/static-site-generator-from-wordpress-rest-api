# Static Site Generator
Based on [Wordpress REST API](http://v2.wp-api.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).

A setup to create a simple and very fast blog / static site based on a Wordpress blog. Some [background information at the blog](https://staticsitegenerator.wordpress.com).

## Getting startet
- Add URL to the `build.js`. First line.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the build `npm start`
- We're done! Your site is now in the `build` directory.

## Roadmap
Larger than Google Maps
