Do you know WordPress? Yes!</p>\n<p>I based my code on a CMS that is very well known among many: WordPress. I know, I know &#8230; before you chop my head off: By using WordPress.com or somehow camouflage your own WordPress-installation you can / might get rid of many hackers. Most of us know how to use WordPress. Even your customer or grandma!</p>\n<p>I believe using WordPress&#8217; REST API is a great way to get content. My goal is to create a static page generator based on blog posts in WordPress. And maybe other stuff from WordPress.
